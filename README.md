# VRGazeTrackerEvaluation
Gaze tracker evaluation in VR devices

## The software
The software implements the VR based gaze tracker evaluation as described in our ICMI 2020 conference paper.
The software consists of two components, the first one collecting gaze data and the second one analyzing the collected data. 
The first components was coded in C# and can be run with any gaze-tracker enabled VR device that implements the Unity environment. 
The second component is more generic and was coded in Python (in Jupyter notebook).

The software is available 'as is' and can be freely used and modified.
