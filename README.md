# VRGazeTrackerEvaluation
Gaze tracker evaluation in VR devices

## The software
The software implements the VR based gaze tracker evaluation as described in our ICMI 2020 conference paper.
The software consists of two components, the first one collecting gaze data and the second one analyzing the collected data. 
The first components was implemented in C# and can be run with any gaze-tracker enabled VR device that implements the Unity environment. 
The second part is more generic software, implemented in Python (in Jupyter notebook).
